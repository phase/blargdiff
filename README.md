#blargtest
`differences.patch` shows the code differences between Blargboard 1.1 and 1.2. Here's what I've been able to gather:

* Some notification changes (not sure if these are super important or not)
* Inner global variables were changed to environment variables
* URL Query changes (code just made better)
* Small CSS changes
